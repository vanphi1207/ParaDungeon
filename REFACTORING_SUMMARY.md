## Major Improvements

### 1. **Added Missing Methods**
- **GUIManager.java**: Added missing `getDungeonIcon()` method that was being referenced but not implemented
  - Properly determines dungeon icons based on player entries and boss stages

### 2. **Constants Extraction** 
Extracted magic numbers to named constants in `RoomManager.java`:
- `DEFAULT_SCORE_PER_KILL = 10`
- `DEFAULT_PROGRESS_BAR_LENGTH = 15`
- `DEFAULT_COUNTDOWN_BAR_LENGTH = 20`
- `MOB_SPAWN_DELAY_TICKS = 5`
- `PARTICLE_ANIMATION_TICKS = 20`
- `PARTICLE_CIRCLE_SEGMENTS = 4`
- `PARTICLE_RADIUS = 1.0`
- `COMPLETION_DELAY_TICKS = 200`
- `FAILURE_DELAY_TICKS = 100`
- `DEFAULT_SOUND_VOLUME = 1.0f`
- `DEFAULT_SOUND_PITCH = 1.0f`

Benefits:
- Improved code readability
- Easier configuration adjustments
- Better maintainability

### 3. **Enhanced Exception Handling**

#### DatabaseManager.java
- Added null checks for all critical operations
- Added connection state validation before operations
- Improved error messages with context
- Added fallback handling for unknown database types
- Added connection status logging
- Implemented `isConnected()` method for connection monitoring

#### DungeonManager.java
- Added null validation for all location operations
- Enhanced error messages with specific context
- Improved type checking in `mapToLocation()` method
- Added graceful handling of missing worlds

#### RoomManager.java
- Added null checks for rooms, players, and dungeons
- Validated player online status before operations
- Added logging for room creation and lifecycle events
- Improved error messages throughout

### 4. **Resource Cleanup & Memory Management**

#### ParaDungeon.java (onDisable)
Enhanced shutdown sequence with proper error handling:
1. Cancel ActionBar task with error handling
2. Cancel all Bukkit scheduled tasks
3. Save all player data with error tracking
4. Clear all dungeon rooms safely
5. Close database connection with cleanup
6. Detailed logging of each step

Benefits:
- Prevents resource leaks
- Ensures data integrity on shutdown
- Better error recovery
- Cleaner plugin lifecycle

### 5. **Database Optimization**

#### Batch Operations
- Converted `savePlayerScores()` to use batch operations instead of individual inserts
- Reduces database round trips significantly
- Better performance with multiple player scores

#### Connection Management
- Added connection pooling awareness
- Implemented connection state checking
- Added graceful handling of closed connections
- Proper resource cleanup with `finally` blocks

### 6. **Null Safety & Validation**

Applied comprehensive null checks across all managers:

**PlayerDataManager**:
- Null check for UUID in `getPlayerData()`
- Safe iteration in `saveAllPlayerData()`

**LeaderboardManager**:
- Validation in `updateLeaderboard()`
- Safe handling of missing dungeons

**RewardManager**:
- Player online status validation
- Null checks for dungeon and rewards

**RoomManager**:
- Comprehensive validation in all public methods
- Safe player state checks
- Dungeon availability verification

### 7. **Documentation & Code Quality**

Added Javadoc comments to major classes:
- `PlayerDataManager`: "Manages player data including entries, scores, and statistics"
- `LeaderboardManager`: "Manages dungeon leaderboards and player rankings"
- `RewardManager`: "Manages dungeon rewards including items and commands"
- `ConfigManager`: "Manages plugin configuration files including messages and GUI configs"

Added method-level documentation for:
- `getPlayerData()`: Parameter and return value documentation
- `saveAllPlayerData()`: Purpose documentation
- `updateLeaderboards()`: Update process documentation
- `giveRewards()`: Parameters and validation documentation

### 8. **Improved Logging**

Enhanced logging throughout the codebase:
- Startup/shutdown sequence logging
- Operation success/failure tracking
- Database operation logging
- Player data save tracking
- Leaderboard update confirmation
- Room lifecycle events

Benefits:
- Better debugging capabilities
- Easier issue diagnosis
- Operation auditing
- Performance monitoring
